# miniproject

This mini project is an application that allows the user to take the COVID-19 daily survey
on their phone and upload the score they have on an online database. The application is made
in Android Studio and was written in Java.

Covid11.0 is the latest version of this application.

The online database that we used is Firebase.

We use Google sign in to authenticate into the app and database. To sign in, use simply open
the app and click on the  "Sign in" button on the main page and log into their Google account.
To sign out, user needs to return to the login page and click on the "Sign out current user"
button.

To take the survey, user click on the "Daily Survey" button on the main page after signing in.
It will take the users to the survey page where the user will answer "yes" or "no" to each
question with the button accordingly. After finishing the survey, the score will be shown to
the user and automatically upload to our online database.
